### 6/24
- Working on dataloader, but pytorch dataloaders are incredibly inefficient for numeric data ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/better-data-loading-20x-pytorch-speed-up-for-tabular-data-e264b9e34352))
- Create more efficient dataloader that handles batches internally (more efficient)

### 6/25
- Working FastTensorLoader implementation and comparisions to pytorch dataLoader
- Identified issues with both approaches and came up with hybrid solution that can be potentially better
- Involves internal batching and shuffling while using pytorch dataLoader multithreading

### 6/28,29
- Working on internal batching and shuffling. Comparisons to original approach still pending
